# MorseCodeTranslator-TDD

I have created a Morse Code Translator using Test Driven Development. For testing, I made unit tests using the Jest library and based on the tests I have created, I have ensured that my functions have met the desired output. 

The testing files are translator.js and translator.spec.js.
